_Disclaimer : Our model is not accurate and the dataset is a sample set_
_Due to some technical issues we were unable to make our program take the prediction of the previous year as an input to predict the future years to improve accuracy_
_The frontend was supposed to live update using data from the backend, however due to a CORS error we have been unable to do so_
